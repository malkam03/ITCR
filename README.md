Malcolm's Path through TEC-CR's CE
=====================
![malkam03](malkam03.png) ![Tec_Logo](tec.png)  
This repository aims to log some of the data of some of the courses that I'll take for the Computer Engineer degree.
Every course is in his own directory if the state of the course is coursed. But if the course is still active, the data will be in one branch with the course name.

## Getting Started
Since every course has his own branch or directory on this repo, just pick a subject and in there you will find the getting started for that specific project/assignment.
