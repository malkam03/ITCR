Course syllabus includes Optimization Principles, Simultaneous Linear Equations Solving, Numerical Regresion, Interpolation, Numerical Integration and Differentiation, Eigensystems among others. The full course syllabus can be found at the course [page](http://www.ie.tec.ac.cr/palvarado/Numerico/programa_2017_S2.pdf).

## Getting Started
Most of the coursework are coding assignments, so every directory has his own README and probably makefile to compile and get things up an running. So just jump in and explore.  
Also, in the slides directory, you can get the slides that the profesor hand out to us.
