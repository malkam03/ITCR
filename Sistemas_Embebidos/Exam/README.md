# Final test

Part of the final test of the course CE-4302 "Arquitectura de Computadores II", first semester 2018.

## Prerequisites

The assignment can be download and compiled for both Windows and GNU/Linux distros, but I will focus on getting things up and running for the latter.  
***Python3***  
It can be installed via the package manager.  
For example for debian based distros you can use apt:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

## Running

For this workshop the goal is to simulate hardware for run zero encoding. A python script can be run with:

```bash
./rze.py a1 a2 [a3 a4 ...]
```

The arguments passed to the script are the values of the array that you wish to encode.
