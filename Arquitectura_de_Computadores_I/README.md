## Getting Started
Most of the coursework are coding assignments, so every directory has his own README and probably makefile to compile and get things up an running. So just jump in and explore. The projects solution for this course will not be uploaded.
Also, in the slides directory, you can get the slides that the profesor hand out to us.
